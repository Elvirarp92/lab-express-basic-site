          <h1>About Emperor Norton</h1>
          <article>
            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>
              Norton's parents were John Norton (d. August 1848) and Sarah
              Norden, who were English Jews. John was a farmer and merchant, and
              Sarah was a daughter of Abraham Norden and a sister of Benjamin
              Norden, a successful merchant. The family moved to South Africa in
              early 1820 as part of a government-backed colonization scheme
              whose participants came to be known as the 1820 Settlers. Most
              likely, Norton was born in the Kentish town of Deptford, today
              part of London. The best available evidence points to February 4,
              1818, as the date of Norton's birth.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are oft-repeated historical claims that Joshua Norton
              arrived in San Francisco on a specific vessel, the Franzeska, on
              November 23, 1849; that he arrived with $40,000, in whole or in
              part a bequest from his father's estate; and that he parlayed this
              into a fortune of $250,000. None of this is substantiated by
              contemporaneous documentation. What is known is that, after Norton
              arrived in San Francisco, he enjoyed a good deal of success in
              commodities markets and in real estate speculation, and that by
              late 1852, he was one of the more prosperous, respected citizens
              of the city.
            </p>
            <p>
              In December 1852, Norton thought he saw a business opportunity
              when China, facing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of
              rice, causing the price of rice in San Francisco to skyrocket from
              four to thirty-six cents per pound (9 to 79 cents/kg). When he
              heard the Glyde, which was returning from Peru, was carrying
              200,000 pounds (91,000 kg) of rice, he bought the entire shipment
              for $25,000 (or twelve and a half cents per pound), hoping to
              corner the market. Shortly after he signed the contract, several
              other shiploads of rice arrived from Peru, causing the price of
              rice to plummet to three cents a pound. Norton tried to void the
              contract, stating the dealer had misled him as to the quality of
              rice to expect. From 1853 to 1856, Norton and the rice dealers
              were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton
              prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court
              of California, which ruled against Norton. Later, the Lucas Turner
              and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North
              Beach to pay Norton's debt. He filed for bankruptcy and by 1858
              was living in reduced circumstances at a working class boarding
              house.

            <h2>Declaration as emperor</h2>
            <p>
              By 1859, Norton had become completely discontented with what he
              considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures
              of the United States. On September 17, 1859, he took matters into
              his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in
              the city, proclaiming himself "Emperor of these United States":
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the
              citizens of these United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of
              Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last 9 years and 10
              months past of San Francisco, California, declare and proclaim
              myself Emperor of these United States; and in virtue of the
              authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct the
              representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble
              in Musical Hall, of this city, on the 1st day of February next,
              then and there to make such alterations in the existing laws of
              the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is
              laboring, and thereby cause confidence to exist, both at home and
              abroad, in our stability and integrity. — NORTON I., Emperor of
              the United States.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The announcement was first printed for humorous effect by the
              editor of the San Francisco Daily Evening Bulletin. Norton later
              added "Protector of Mexico" to this title, and thus began his
              whimsical 21-year "reign" over America. An undated proclamation
              issued by Emperor Norton I regarding the assumption of his
              prerogatives by "certain parties" on display at the Wells Fargo
              History Museum in San Francisco, California. One of Norton's
              undated proclamations Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of
              the state, including a decree on October 12, 1859 to formally
              abolish the United States Congress. In it, he observed:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the
              public voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly
              occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence
              of political sects; that the citizen has not that protection of
              person and property which he is entitled.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              In an imperial decree on March 1860, Norton summoned the Army to
              depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress. Norton's orders
              were ignored by the Army, and Congress likewise continued without
              any formal acknowledgement of the decree. Further decrees in 1860
              ordered dissolution of the republic and forbade the assembly of
              any members of the former Congress. Norton's battle against the
              elected leaders of America persisted for the remainder of his
              life. He issued a mandate in 1862 ordering both the Roman Catholic
              Church and the Protestant churches to publicly ordain him as
              "Emperor", hoping to resolve the many disputes that had resulted
              in the Civil War. Norton then turned his attention to other
              matters, both political and social. He declared the abolition of
              the Democratic and Republican parties on August 12, 1869, "being
              desirous of allaying the dissensions of party strife now existing
              within our realm".
            </p>
            <p>
              Norton was occasionally a visionary, and some of his Imperial
              Decrees exhibited profound foresight. He issued instructions to
              form a League of Nations, he explicitly forbade any form of
              conflict between religions or their sects, and he decreed the
              construction of a suspension bridge or tunnel connecting Oakland
              and San Francisco. His later decrees, however, became increasingly
              irritated at the lack of prompt obedience by the authorities. Long
              after his death, similar structures were built in the form of the
              San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube, and there
              have been campaigns to rename the bridge "The Emperor Norton
              Bridge".

            <h2>Norton's Imperial acts</h2>
            <p>
              Norton spent his days inspecting San Francisco's streets in an
              elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, given to him
              by officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San
              Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock
              feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this imperial
              posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, he would
              examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state
              of repair of public property, and the appearance of police
              officers. He would also frequently give lengthy philosophical
              expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 1860s and 1870s, there were occasional anti-Chinese
              demonstrations in the poorer districts of San Francisco, and riots
              took place, sometimes resulting in fatalities. During one
              incident, Norton allegedly positioned himself between the rioters
              and their Chinese targets; with a bowed head, he started reciting
              the Lord's Prayer repeatedly until the rioters dispersed without
              incident.
            </p>
            <p>
              Special officer Armand Barbier was part of a local auxiliary force
              whose members were called "policemen" but in fact were private
              security guards paid by neighborhood residents and business
              owners, and he arrested Norton in 1867 to commit him to
              involuntary treatment for a mental disorder. The arrest outraged
              the citizens and sparked scathing editorials in the newspapers,
              including the Daily Alta which wrote "that he had shed no blood;
              robbed no one; and despoiled no country; which is more than can be
              said of his fellows in that line." Police Chief Patrick Crowley
              ordered Norton released and issued a formal apology on behalf of
              the police force, and Norton granted an Imperial Pardon to
              Barbier. Police officers of San Francisco thereafter saluted him
              as he passed in the street. Norton did receive some tokens of
              recognition for his position. The 1870 U.S. census lists Joshua
              Norton as 50 years old and residing at 624 Commercial Street, and
              his occupation is listed as "Emperor". It also notes that he was
              insane.
            </p>
            <p>
              Norton issued his own money in the form of scrips which were
              accepted from him by restaurants in San Francisco. These notes
              came in denominations between fifty cents and ten dollars, and the
              few surviving notes are collector's items. The city of San
              Francisco also honored Norton. When his uniform began to look
              shabby, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors bought him a
              suitably imperial replacement. Norton sent a gracious thank you
              note and issued a "patent of nobility in perpetuity" for each
              supervisor.

            <h2>Later years and death</h2>
            <p>
              On the evening of January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed on the corner
              of California Street and Dupont Street (now Grant Avenue) in front
              of Old Saint Mary's Cathedral while on his way to a lecture at the
              California Academy of Sciences. His collapse was immediately
              noticed, and "the police officer on the beat hastened for a
              carriage to convey him to the City Receiving Hospital", according
              to the next day's obituary in the San Francisco Morning Call.
              Norton died before a carriage could arrive. The Call reported, "On
              the reeking pavement, in the darkness of a moonless night, under
              the dripping rain... Norton I, by the grace of God, Emperor of the
              United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life". Two
              days later, the San Francisco Chronicle led its article on
              Norton's funeral with the headline "Le Roi Est Mort."
            </p>
            <p>
              It quickly became evident that Norton had died in complete
              poverty, contrary to rumors of wealth. Five or six dollars in
              small change was found on his person, and a search of his room at
              the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single gold
              sovereign, worth around $2.50. His possessions included his
              collection of walking sticks, his rather battered saber, a variety
              of headgear including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap,
              and another cap suited to a martial band-master, an 1828 French
              franc, and a handful of the Imperial bonds that he sold to
              tourists at a fictitious 7% interest. There were fake telegrams
              purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia
              congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen
              Victoria, and from the President of France predicting that such a
              union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his
              letters to Queen Victoria and 98 shares of stock in a defunct gold
              mine.
            </p>

              Initial funeral arrangements were for a pauper's coffin of simple
              redwood. However, members of a San Francisco businessmen's
              association called the Pacific Club established a funeral fund
              that provided for a handsome rosewood casket and arranged a
              dignified farewell. Norton's funeral on Sunday, January 10 was
              solemn, mournful, and large. Paying their respects were members of
              "all classes from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the
              pickpocket, well-dressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing
              hinted of the social outcast". It was reported that as many as
              10,000 people lined the streets, and that the funeral cortège was
              two miles (3 km) long. Norton was buried in the Masonic Cemetery
              at the expense of the City of San Francisco.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1934, Emperor Norton's remains were transferred to a grave site
              at Woodlawn Cemetery in Colma, California, as were all graves in
              the city.
