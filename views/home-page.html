              Joshua Abraham Norton (February 4, 1818 â€“ January 8, 1880), known
              as Emperor Norton, was a citizen of San Francisco, California, who
              proclaimed himself "Norton I, Emperor of the United States" in
              1859. In 1863 he took the secondary title of "Protector of Mexico"
              after Napoleon III invaded that country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Norton had no formal political power; nevertheless, he was treated
              deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name
              was honored in the establishments that he frequented. Some
              considered him insane or eccentric, but citizens of San Francisco
              celebrated his imperial presence and his proclamations, such as
              his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force
              and his numerous decrees calling for the construction of a bridge
              and tunnel crossing San Francisco Bay to connect San Francisco
              with Oakland.
